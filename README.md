 Assignment Compiler : Amilcar Aponte 


## Assignment Introduction
You have been provided with access to a real database server that contains only one table (country), and have been tasked to develop a Java program in charge of:
* Retrieve all records stored in the database table
* Retrieve records by country name
* Retrieve records by country code
* Add new records into the database

## Specific Requirements
* You are required to implement the Data Access Object pattern, in combination with any other two creational patterns of your choice.
* You also have to create a simple CLI client program to test your implementation of the patterns.
* The client program should not have any direct contact with the database and should pass and receive data in the form of objects (instances of a Country class).
